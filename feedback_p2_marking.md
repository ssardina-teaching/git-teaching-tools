The final marks (out of 100) is calculated as follows: üì±

* **RAW MARKS** = ((RAW_POINTS / TOTAL_POINTS)*TOTAL_WEIGHT_ADJUSTMENT)*100
* **FINAL MARKS** = RAW MARKS - LATE PENALTY

### üì¢ Automarking Report & Feedback

For details about the marking scheme, see:  
- [Ed post #418](https://edstem.org/au/courses/25332/discussion/2970696)  
- [Marking guide explanation](https://github.com/RMIT-COSC1127-3117-AI25/AI25-DOC/blob/main/MARKING-P2.md)

---

We hope the feedback is clear and detailed.  The marking is **automated and objective**, based on **unit-testing best practices**, so there is limited room for subjective reconsideration.  

‚úÖ If you believe there is a **factual error** in the marking (e.g. your code does *not* use a forbidden predicate but the report says it does), please **comment HERE in this PRüëáüèæ** with supporting evidence.  
‚ùå Do **not** send emails or make forum posts‚Äîrequests outside this PR will not be processed.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Please do **not** ask for ‚Äúreconsideration‚Äù of subjective matters (e.g. *‚ÄúI think my code is better than what the report says‚Äù*). Messages begging for marks will not be answered.  

‚è∞ Any challenges or requests must be made **within 5 working days** of this feedback. After that, marks will be considered final.

### üîç Before Contacting Us

Please carefully review:

- The feedback in this report.
- The marking guide and Ed post above.  
- Your submitted code. The best learning happens when YOU ü´µ found the issue by yourself.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Key Reminders

1. **SE/Git Development**  
   - The goal is to show **evidence of your development process**.  
   - We used a **very low bound of {NO_COMMITS_EXPECTED} commits** for a perfect solution (scaled pro-rata on points achieved).  
   - Fewer commits strongly suggests issues with the development process.  
   - This expectation has been made clear multiple times (spec, lectorials, forum, feedback).  
   - üôè Being ‚Äúsorry‚Äù does not earn marks back.

2. **Language Restrictions**  
   - The spec was explicit about which Prolog built-ins are allowed and which are forbidden (see *Language restrictions and guidelines*).  
   - Any test using a forbidden predicate will score **0 points** for that item, regardless of other functionality.  
   - We have already been lenient in not disqualifying the whole question.  
   - üôè Again, apologies are not a substitute for following the rules.

‚û°Ô∏è Please respond here **only** if you have evidence of a factual error, or if something is genuinely unclear after you have carefully reviewed the resources above.
