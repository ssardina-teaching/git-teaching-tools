-------------------------

✅ Your code has been **automarked for technical correctness**, and your **preliminary grades are now recorded**.

Please note:

- The results shown above reflect **only the automarking component** of your grade. They are based on the raw points system from the spec (not yet weighted). The **final grade** will be calculated using the weighted points as described in the spec.  
- In addition to automarking, we will be conducting **code similarity checks**, and **manual inspections** of repos and codebases. We reserve the right to adjust marks, or to request a demo meeting with you if necessary, at any point during the course.
