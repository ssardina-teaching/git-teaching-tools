-------------------------
Your code has been automarked for technical correctness and your grades are now preliminary registered!

Please note the following:

- We will be running code similarity checks, as well as inspecting reports and code manually, in an ongoing basis for all the projects. We reserve the right to adjust the marks or to have a demo meeting with you, if necessary.
- The total points above is raw and does not reflect the weighting of each question (as per spec.).

Thanks for your submission & hope you enjoyed and learnt from this Pacman Search project!

The final marks (out of 100) is calculated as follows: üì±

* **RAW MARKS** = ((RAW_POINTS / TOTAL_POINTS)*TOTAL_WEIGHT_ADJUSTMENT)*100
* **FINAL MARKS** = RAW MARKS - LATE PENALTY

For more information on marking scheme, refer to post [#224](https://edstem.org/au/courses/25332/discussion/2880419).

Hope the above feedback is clear and detailedü§û, but if you spot any factual error in the marking or you really need clarification (after carefully analysing the feedback), please **post HERE in this PR** üëáüèæ: _do not send email or make posts in the forum_.

Remember the SE/GIT development aims to have minimal **evidence of the process towards the solution in your development**. The expected commits is a bare minimum that serves as _proxy_ to signal a problem, not an aim in itself (that is why it is so low). For this project, we used a **very low bound of {NO_COMMITS_EXPECTED} commits** for a _perfect solution_ (pro-rata on points achieved); less than strongly suggests problem with development.
